Pink Monitor
============

RPC and utility functions used to communicate with Pinkcoin full node and gather statistical data.

Work in progress, right now it's possible to call most of Pinkcoin RPCs and fill PostgreSQL database
with blocks data (collect_blocks_data.py).

Jupyter notebooks contain some data analysis and graphs.
